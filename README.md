# Medical-Insurance-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the medical insurance costs for individuals based on their age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and other related factors. The dataset used in this project contains information about medical insurance costs for a group of people based on these factors.
